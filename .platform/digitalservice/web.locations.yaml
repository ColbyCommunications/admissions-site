    # Multi domain multisites do not respect the WP_SITEURL constant in Wp-config. Since the vast majority of
    # migrated multisites were not set up using this constant, their siteurl location is hard-coded into the db
    # Because of this, WordPress and plugins are unaware that core files are located in /wp/. This allows those
    # sites to continue to function properly, and single sites are unaffected as they respect the WP_SITEURL
    # constant. New multisites set up with the new paradigm will have their siteurl setting set correctly and will
    # also not be affected by this setting.
